Sniperbot

To make sure the bot runs smoothly,
Make sure these rules apply to you:

1. Windows 10

2. Taskbar is small
To change taskbar settings, right click on the bottom of your screen > taskbar settings > Use small taskbar buttons

3. Use monitor 1 if you have 2 monitors

4. Download tesseract and install to (default) path C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe (if you change this, you have to change the path in all occurrences of `tesspytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'` - or just don't change it!)

5. Run the bot!
